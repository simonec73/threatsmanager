# Importers & Exporters

The Threats Manager Importers & Exporters Extensions library contains logic and modules to import from Excel files, for example to generate Mitigations from some Azure Security Baseline, or to export to Excel files. The library cal also generate multiple Knowledge Bases from Excel files automatically.


## How to Build

The requirements and prerequisites are the same of the Engine. On top of that, it requires Syncfusion.XlsIO.Net.Core. Syncfusion provides Community licenses for free: see <https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/communitylicense> for information about your eligibility and eventually apply. You should not need a license to build and load this Extension library or any other library based on Syncfusion WinForms, because the license is embedded in Threats Manager Studio.
Of course, you will need a license if you create a something not directly hosted in Threats Manager Studio.
